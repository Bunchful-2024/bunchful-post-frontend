# 0. Overview 

Bunchful Post is an AI-powered web application that assists in content management over several platforms. The app not only increases work efficiency for Bunchful Team but also serves as an important tool in creating potential revenue for Bunchful.

# 1. Rationale 
As Bunchful expands its content platform presence, managing posts becomes challenging due to the manual, repetitive process required for each platform. Tailoring content to each platform's unique style is also time-consuming, reducing productivity and limiting audience engagement. 

While there are existing tools, they couldn't fulfill Bunchful's need to focus on article platforms such as Medium, Hub Pages, etc. 

# 2. Functions
## 2.1 Functions Overview
Bunchful Post is an AI-powered web application that assists in content management. It has two main functions: Content Generation and Automated Posting.  
- Content Curation: Leverages Gemini to compose tailored content for various content types. Considering diverse target audiences, it assists in crafting customized content, such as social media posts, articles, blogs, and newsletters.  
- Automated Posting: After generating content, users can directly publish the content to the platforms with a single click. It eliminates the need for manual uploading, saving time and effort. 

## 2.2 Non-goals
- This project doesn't support the following functions: Posting to Multiple Platforms at once, Post Scheduling, and Performance Analytics.

- This project currently supports posting on Medium and Facebook, gradually increasing the amount of platforms.

# 3. Tech Stack

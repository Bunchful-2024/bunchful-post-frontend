# Introduction 
## Rationale  
As Bunchful expands its content platform presence, managing posts becomes challenging due to the manual, repetitive process required for each platform. Tailoring content to each platform's unique style is also time-consuming, reducing productivity and limiting audience engagement. While there are existing social media management tools, they couldn't fulfill the needs of Bunchful as most of them focus on popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc. Thus, the team is building a tool for Bunchful to manage its content over 19 platforms.  
## Non-goals
1. This project doesn't include the following functions: Post Scheduling, Performance Analytics.
2. This project at the current stage aims to integrate 4-5 social media platforms, gradually increasing the amount.
